Coronagram is a social media platform I created while in quarantine. The website is functionally similar to the Instagram site. Users are able to register, login, create and edit profiles, create post with captions and photos, comment on posts, follow other users, and be followed by other users. The project uses the Laravel PHP framework for the back end, Vue.js Javascript framework for the front end, and SQLite for the relational database. Other technologies used in the project are Composer, Bootstrap 4, Axios, Webpack.js, Node.js, and NPM.
